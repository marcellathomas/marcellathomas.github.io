   <li>"February 1957: One of the first published studies about campus sexual assault, “Male Sex Aggression on a University Campus” appears in the American Sociological Review (Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 52-58).</li>

    <li>1975: The term “date rape” is coined by Susan Brownmiller in reference to a dating situation in which “an aggressor may press his advantage to the point where pleasantness quickly turns to unpleasantness and more than the woman</li> bargained for.” (Women’s Studies Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, page 337, Greenwood Publishing Group.)

“Why was slavery institutionalized in American society, then rendered extinct? Wasn’t it a social custom? We could go on and on in describing extinct social norms from language to child-rearing. Why hasn’t this society applied itself to RAPE in a similar vain? Because crime, that is, certain crime has a monopoly on dividends and RAPE is a major source of political and economical revenue or capital. It is a great “law and order” slogan. It’s an asset to man’s rule and male supremacy as opposed to a liability. - Sarah Dessen

“Rape is one of the most terrible crimes on earth and it happens every few minutes. The problem with groups who deal with rape is that they try to educate women about how to defend themselves. What really needs to be done is teaching men not to rape. Go to the source and start there.” 
― Kurt Cobain
